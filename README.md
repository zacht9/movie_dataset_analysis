### Movie Dataset Analysis
This is a data science project I did for a university class. In it, I:
- Clean a movie dataset
- Run some hypothesis tests to determine correlation between variables
- Generate graphs using Seaborn
- Use NLTK for sentiment analysis of movie reviews
- Create and test a random forest model to predict whether or not a movie was a success
